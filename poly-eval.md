**Question.**    
Let $$p$$ be a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients. You have access to a machine that, given any $$n\in\mathbb N$$, returns $$p(n)$$. Give an algorithm to evaluate $$p$$.    
Assume that any other mathematical operations to be performed take no time and that the dominating factor is the number of calls you make to the machine.

	<summary> <b>Hint</b> </summary>

It is possible to evaluate it with just \(2\) calls to the machine.

Use the machine to get \(p(1)\) and \(p(p(1)+1)\). Observe that when the latter is represented in base \(p(1)+1\), the digits correspond to coefficients of the polynomial (since any coefficient is at most \(p(1)\)). The required follows.
