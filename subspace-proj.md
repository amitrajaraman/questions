**Question.**
Given a $$k$$-dimensional subspace $$V$$ of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, show that there exist indices $$i_1,\ldots,i_k$$ such that on defining $$W = \operatorname{span}(e_{i_1}, e_{i_2}, \ldots, e_{i_k})$$, the function $$\pi : V \to W$$ that projects any vector $$v \in V$$ onto $$W$$ is a bijection.

	<summary> <b>Solution</b> </summary>

Let \(v_1,\ldots,v_k\) be a basis of \(V\). Consider the \(n \times k\) matrix \(M\) with \(M_{ij}\) equal to the \(i\)th coordinate of \(v_j\). Because the \(v_i\) are linearly independent, \(M\) has column rank \(k\). Consequently, it has row rank \(k\) so there are indices (row numbers) \(i_1,\ldots,i_k\) such that the \(k \times k\) submatrix of \(M\) with these rows is full-rank. Consequently, the projections of these basis elements (onto the \(W\) corresponding to these indices) are linearly independent, so \(\pi\) is an injection and we are done.
