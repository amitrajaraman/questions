title:	Nice Questions

This is a small collection of questions whose solutions I found neat. The solutions tend to very short and sweet, without any heavy machinery involved, just mildly clever ideas.

* [Let $$R$$ be a rectangle that can be partitioned into smaller rectangles with sides parallel to those of $$R$$, each of which has at least one side of integer length. Prove that $$R$$ has at least one side of integer length.](./rect-part)
* [Let $$p$$ be a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients. You have access to a machine that, given any $$n\in\mathbb N$$, returns $$p(n)$$. Give an algorithm to find $$p$$.](./poly-eval)
* [Given a $$3$$-SAT instance with $$m$$ clauses, show that there is an assignment that satisfies $$7m/8$$ of the clauses.](./3-sat-7m8)
* [Show that the edge crossing number of a graph with $$n$$ vertices and $$m>4n$$ edges is at least $$m^3/64n^2$$.](edge-crossing)
* [Given a $$k$$-dimensional subspace $$V$$ of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, show that there exist indices $$i_1,\ldots,i_k$$ such that on defining $$W = \operatorname{span}(e_{i_1}, e_{i_2}, \ldots, e_{i_k})$$, the projection function $$\pi_W : V \to W$$ is a bijection.](subspace-proj)
* [Let $$A_1,\ldots,A_n$$ be distinct subsets of $$[n]$$. Prove that there always exists $$i \in [n]$$ such that the sets $$(B_i)$$ defined by $$B_i = A_i \setminus \{i\}$$ are distinct.](distinct-sets)
