**Question.**    
Given a $$3$$-SAT instance with $$m$$ clauses, show that there is an assignment that satisfies (at least) $$7m/8$$ of the clauses.

	<summary> <b>Solution</b> </summary>

Let \(X\) be a uniform random variable on the set of possible assignments. Consider the random variable \(f(X)\), where for any model \(m\), \(f(m)\) represents the number of true clauses under it.    
The probability of a particular clause being true under an assignment chosen from \(X\) is \(7/8\). Linearity of expectation implies that the expectation of \(f(X)\) is \(7m/8\). The required follows since the maximum of the random variable (which is attained for some assignment) is at least equal to its expectation.

**Question.**    
Given any $$3$$-SAT instance with $$m$$ clauses, give a quadratic time algorithm to find an assignment that satisfies (at least) $$7m/8$$ of the clauses.

Try splitting into cases and using the above result.

	<summary> <b>Solution</b> </summary>

Let \(x_1\) be a variable in the formula. Consider \(\mathbb{E}[f(X)\mid x_1 = 0]\) and \(\mathbb{E}[f(X)\mid x_1 = 1]\). Since the arithmetic mean of the two is at least \(7m/8\), one of the two must be at least \(7m/8\). Further, both of them can be computed quite easily. We then recurse on the corresponding smaller subproblem. The required follows.

**An Interesting Follow-up.**    
Assuming $$\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$$, for any $$\varepsilon>0$$, there is no polynomial time algorithm that, for any $$3$$-SAT instance, finds an assignment that satisfies (at least) $$(7/8 + \varepsilon)m$$ of the clauses.

The proof of the above is _far_ more non-trivial compared to the previous two. Interested readers can learn more in [this paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.5701&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Johan HÃ¥stad.
